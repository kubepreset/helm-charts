## Usage

[Helm][helm] must be installed to use the charts.  Please refer to Helm's
[documentation][helm-docs] to get started.

Once Helm has been set up correctly, add the repo as follows:

```
helm repo add kubepreset https://kubepreset.github.io/helm-charts
```

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve
the latest versions of the packages.  You can then run `helm search repo
kubepreset` to see the charts.

To install the `kubepreset` chart:

```
helm install my-kubepreset kubepreset/kubepreset
```

To uninstall the chart:

```
helm delete my-kubepreset
```
